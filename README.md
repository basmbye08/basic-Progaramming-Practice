# Python-Basics-Practice 🚀

This repository is a collection of my **basic programming practice** across different languages.  
It shows my learning journey as I practice solving problems in Python, C, Java, and more.  

---

## 📂 Structure

- **python/** → All Python scripts, organized by topic (conditionals, loops, functions, etc.)  
- **c/** → Practice programs in C (arrays, searching, etc.)  
- **java/** → Practice programs in Java (conditionals, loops, etc.)  
- **misc/** → Small experiments in any language  

---

## 📝 Topics Covered
- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`, `switch/match`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, nested loops)  
- Arrays, Strings, Functions  
- Simple projects (tax calculator, result calculator, etc.)  

---

## ⚡ Example Programs
- Positive/Negative/Zero checker  
- Tax calculator  
- Student Result Calculator with weightage  
- Array insertion/deletion (C)  
- Traffic Light simulation (Java)  

---

## 🎯 Goal
This repo is a **practice archive**, not polished projects.  
For my **real-life projects**, I will be creating other repos later.
